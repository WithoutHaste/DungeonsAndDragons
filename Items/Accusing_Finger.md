# Accusing Finger

![Accusing Finger](/Items/Images/Accusing_Finger.jpg)

From [Scenario 003](/Scenarios/003_Non_Combat_In_Tunly.md)

A shriveled finger in a jar. To create this item, you need a finger from someone who died with vengeance unsatisfied.

When you are within 300 feet of a hidden foe, the finger will tap on the glass in the direction of the enemy. This only works for the specific enemy you created the item for.

If you do not return the jar to Gurta within a week after defeating the enemy (or settling the matter another way), the whoever carries the jar will be struck by a Shriveling Curse.

If you lose or leave the jar behind, the last person in the party to carry it will be struck by a Shriveling Curse.

If the jar is opened or broken, every creature within 10 feet will be struck by a Numbness Curse. The jar loses all magical powers.

## Numbness Curse

Your hands are numbed. This only affects creatures with actual hands.

Roll at disadvantage for anything requiring your hands.

This effect lasts for 1 month of in-game time.

## Shriveling Curse

You'll begin to lose feeling in your pinkies, this will spread across their fingers and gradually up the arms. After a week, your pinkies will start to shrivel up and die - this will also spread.

Returning the jar to its owner will stop the illness and numbness, but will not heal anything shriveled.
