# Scenario 001: Tunly Harvest Festival

Intended for:
- 4 players at Level 1  
- to introduce the rules to new players
- as a simple story for a first-time DM

Setting: [Town of Tunly](/Locations/Town_Tunly.md)  

Author: Without Haste

## Summary

You show up in a new town

They are setting up for a harvest festival tonight, but the best entries in the jack 'o lantern competition have been stolen!

The townspeople ask you to find and return them, for a small reward.

You track the pumpkins to a field outside town, where a druid is using them in a ritual.

You must fight off his scarecrow monsters to reclaim the pumpkins. You must also not damage the pumpkins while they (animated) grapple your feet.

The druid will not fight you directly. He will 100% escape alive.

You are invited to enjoy the festival, and are given a minor reward based on how many pumpkins came back safe.

## Arrival

Your band of adventurers is walking East on the road that leads to the [Standing Forest](/Locations/Standing_Forest.md), in late afternoon on a crisp fall day. 

To your left are fields empty except for the scarecrows and a grove of trees.

To your right are the walls of [Tunly Town](/Locations/Town_Tunly.md).

A ways ahead is the Mallow River ford, over-shadowed by the Forest.

**Details**
- The walls are wooden palisades, 10 feet tall, in good repair
- The fields look to have recently held wheat, but they've been harvested
- It's a perfect fall day, with a crystal blue sky and scattered clouds. A light breeze chills you.
- There are various locals around, all of whom are heading into town. Many of them are wearing their best clothes, or a bit of floral or ivy decoration. If you ask one of them what's going on, they tell the Harvest Festival starts tonight.
- Pumpkins are piled at each side of the town gate, in every size from cantaloupe up to beer barrel. There are sheafs of wheat hung on the town walls above the pumpkins.

**Direct Adventurers into Town**
- You're tired from a long day of travel. You think about how good a dark ale and rich stew would taste right now.
- You can hear pieces of cheerful music drifting over the town walls. There is a festival feel in the air.
- You find your feet have turned onto the town road, and you're approaching the open gates.

**DM Notes**
- For scenario setup, mention the scarecrows in original description. If you haven't described the pumpkins by the time the adventurers approach the gate, mention it then.

## Town Gates

As you make to enter the gates, a guardsman breaks away from a lively discussion nearby and jogs over to you, saying "Hail, strangers!"

-- possible player actions --

He seems to be in a hurry, and still trying to listen to the group he left. He continues "5 coppers to enter Tunly. No fighting inside the walls, and NO fireballs. That's 5 coppers _each_ by the way."

-- possible player actions --

**Details**
- This is [Guardsman Fyodor](/Characters/Family_Knapik.md#Fyodor)
- He, some other guards, and [Blacksmith Reinhardt](/Characters/Family_Gmerek.md#Reinhardt) were talking together
- Several of the town's jack 'o lantern competition entries have gone missing! And one them was _his_ entry!
  - "I called it 'Old Grumpy', and it's gone! How do you like that, on Festival night, too."
  - "I'd track down the dirty thief myself, but I'm stuck on gate duty."
- Once you pay, he drops the coins into the official pouch at his belt
- If you ask if he wants you to find his pumpkin, he waves you off "Aw, the mayor's looking into it. They've probably found them already - just a bunch of kids playing around."

## Town Square

The main street leads into what is clearly the town square, and it is bustling with activity. There are sheafs of wheat hanging on every door, and ivy is strung overhead.

There are tables and benches everywhere, already being loaded with every sort of pie and vegetable.

A loud voice draw your attention to the people crowded around a table covered with jack 'o lanterns.

-- possible player actions --

**Details**
- To your right is an inn with a sign displaying a white crow (the White Crow tavern). Laborers are carrying casks out of the alleyway next to the inn, and lining them up for the feast. [Barmaid Beata](/Characters/Family_Knapik.md#Beata) works here.
- Musicians are warming up next to an open area among the tables. You hear a lyre, drums, and a multitude of pipes.
- The tables are heaped with potatoes, beetroots, carrots, cabbages, pears, apples, baskets of mushrooms, squash, zucchini, radishes, and garlic. You can smell shepherd's pie, mince pie, and rhubarb pie. The meat dishes clearly haven't been brought out yet.

**Talking with the Mayor**
- There are 7 forlorn pumpkin bottoms sitting on the table, with their jack 'o lanterns missing. There are at least 12 pumpkins remaining on the table, carved with fanciful faces. The smallest must weigh at least 1 Stone.
- The man talking is [Mayor Bertrum Dembek](/Characters/Family_Dembek.md#Bertrum). He wears a yellow sash and has brass buttons on his coat.
  - A young woman (his daughter [Yelena](/Characters/Family_Dembek.md#Yelena)) is at his side, trying to calm him down.  Yelena's is one of the missing pumpkins.
- The Mayor is yelling at everyone at once that "This is an outrage! Who was watching the table? How can you not notice seven (SEVEN!) pumpkins wandering off?"
  - Yelena says "Papa, I'm sure berger Lenski did his best."
  - (if the players don't step in yet) The mayor continues "I want these pumpkins found and returned at once! My daughter made an _excellent_ entry this year. This is clearly sabotage of the most craven sort!"

-- players should really have gotten involved by now --

**The Quest**
- The mayor wants all seven pumpkins returned before the feast starts "Indeed, how can we start the feast _without_ the jack 'o lanterns?"
- He's offering 1 silver piece per pumpkin for their safe return

**DM Notes**
- The Druid used 2nd level spell Pass Without Trace to steal the jack 'o lanterns
- A "stone" equals 14 pounds
- The mayor will only pay out for each unharmed pumpkin you return

## Investigation

Intelligence (Investigation) check DC 8: you notice pumpkin seeds on the ground, leading back along the main street
- The jack 'o lanterns are all carved with the bottom cut out, and the bottoms of the stolen pumpkins were left behind, allowing some overlooked seeds to drop to the ground.
- At DC 14 and you notice that there is also straw along this path, different from the wheat that is hung on the doors.

(if the party totally fails to pick up the seed path, then boy [Oscar](/Characters/Family_Pytel.md#Oscar) will volunteer his dog Dug, who can follow the trail based on sniffing one of the pumpkin bottoms - Oscar and the dog will run back home once they see the monster scarecrows moving)

The party follows the trail out the gates and see it leads into the empty fields.
- Night is falling 
- There is Dim Light

-- pause for actions --

As they cross the fields, they're getting close to the grove of trees which blocks their vision to the left. The path seems to be curving around the grove.

-- pause for actions --

Once they get around or through the trees, they see another harvested field - this one used to be a pumpkin patch. The dead vines are still twisted across the ground.

100 feet from the grove is a man kneeling in a circle of 7 jack 'o lanterns. There are 2 scarecrows positioned around him as well (outside the jack 'o lanterns). The man is making complex arcane gestures. There is a short alter in front of him, with a lit torch.
- False Appearance: while the scarecrow remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary, inanimate scarecrow.
- Intelligence (Arcana) check DC 10: you know that he is in the middle of a ritual
- Intelligence (Arcana) check DC 18: you know that he is casting something that resembles Plant Growth, but is far more complex
- Wisdom (Insight) check DC 12: you know that he is up to no good

This man is [The Autumnal Driud](/Characters/Druid_Meinrad_Ozga.md).

If you approach within 80 Feet, he will notice you but continue the ritual.

If you try to talk to him, he will scowl but ignore you and continue the ritual.
- Charisma (Intimidation) check DC 13: to make him afraid enough to stop the ritual
- Charisma (Persuasion) check DC 18: to make him stop the ritual long enough to explain himself
- Make a move to pick up a pumpkin, and he will stop the ritual to yell at you
- Attack and he will stop the ritual to yell at you and attack you
- Or, as my party did, pester him until he just can't concentrate anymore.

**The Druid shouts about his plan**
- He is The Autumnal Druid!
- He is going to reawaken the Standing Forest (gestures grandly to the forest across the river) so it can become the Walking Forest again, as it was in times of yore
- How dare you try to stop him!
- My scarecrows! Attack!

## Combat

Once combat begins, the Druid will order his scarecrows to attack the party
- The scarecrows roll for Initiative like normal.
- The jack 'o lanterns all come in last place in Initiative.
- The Druid will NOT fight at all, and will quickly flee (leaving the scarecrows and pumpkins to continue attacking).
- You cannot defeat or capture the Druid - he will always escape.

**FRIGHTENED**: Disadvantage on ability checks and attack roles (while scarecrow is in line of sight), plus you cannot willingly move closer to the scarecrow

Once all the scarecrows have been destroyed, the jack 'o lanterns will return to normal.

If they inspect the alter they find
- a lit torch
- a small bowl of salt
- a sickle with a broken handle
- a bundle of tobacco leaves, smoldering
- 5 pinecones

**DM Notes**
- I used 2 scarecrows because my party includes a Druid with Druidcraft cantrip - they can just set things on fire as much as they want.
- I also lowered the Claw Attack from 2d4 + 1 to 1d4 because I really don't want to kill anyone in our first game. And I halved the scarecrows' HP.
- I lowered the Scarecrow XP since I nerfed their states, and so we'd have more games before everyone levels up.
- If the party is getting overwhelmed, have some townspeople come running out to help
  - the Druid will call off any remaining scarecrows and they'll all run away
  - the Druid will use Pass Without Trace to escape
  - the Druid has 100% success at escaping

## After Combat

The players should pick up whatever undamaged jack 'o lanterns remain and carry them back to the festival
- a Small player (halfling, dwarf) can carry 1 pumpkin with both arms
- a Medium player can carry 1 pumpkin with each arm

If the players have damaged any pumpkins, and they think of carving replacement jack 'o lanterns in a hurry, remember there is a pile at the gates
- Stealth check DC 5 to steal pumpkins
- Intelligence check DC 10 to remember what it should look like
- Dexterity check DC 14 to carve
- for any pumpkin that failed the Intelligence or Dexterity check, you can replace them with a Charisma check DC 12 to convince the owner this is what it always looked like

## Wrap Up

Return the jack 'o lanterns to the Mayor for congratulations and silver.

If you fail to convince the townspeople that your fake jack 'o lanterns are the original
- The Mayor claps you on the shoulder "Ha ha, if you want to enter the competition, you should have just said so!"
- Your entries will not win

Reward
- mayor gives you 1 silver per jack 'o lantern returned
- +100 XP if you succeed in returning 7 jack 'o lanterns (or their replacements)
