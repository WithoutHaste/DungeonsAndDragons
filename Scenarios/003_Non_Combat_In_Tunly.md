## Summary

Various non-combat encounters in Tunly, and opportunity to gather supplies before heading into the forest.

## Introduction

Last night, you all became the Heros of the Lantern by rescuing jack 'o lanterns from a mysterious druid's ritual. This morning, you helped save the town from a goblin raiding party.

You have been enjoying another fine meal at the White Crow. It is now afternoon.

As you eat, two villagers arrived with messages.
- The first one says that if you come to the Apothecary Shop, you'll gain something to your advantage.
- The second one says that you collect your loot from the goblin battle at the Blacksmith's Shop. He's offering you a fair trade-in value on the scrap weaponry.

If you ask [the barmaid](/Characters/Family_Knapik.md#Beata) about where to find these shops
- Apothecary: "Oh, that'll be [Old Gurta](/Characters/Family_Aldag.md#Gurta). Turn left out the door, then a right and a left and all the way down."
- Blacksmith: "Take the street opposite us out of town square. [The blacksmith](/Characters/Family_Gmerek.md#Reinhardt) is the one with all the hammers."

(the players can move around town as they like)

## The Blacksmith

[Blacksmith Reinhardt](/Characters/Family_Gmerek.md#Reinhardt)

### Minor encounter: Riddles

Bard Lech is standing in town square, next to the street that leads to the blacksmith's shop. A small crowd is around him, scratching their heads and thinking hard.

He calls to your party: "And you good sirs and madam, I've heard tell of your prowess with a sword. How about trying your hand at a riddle?"

His offer to all is that you can pay 1 silver to try to answer his riddle. If you are correct, you win 10 shiny silver coins. He's single-handed juggling silver as he talks.

**Riddle 1**
- "With four great sails, I stand stock-still. On seas of wheat, I ply my trade with skill...What am I?"
- Answer: a windmill
- The folks around applaud if you get it right.

If you solve the first one, he offers double or nothing on a second riddle.
- He will pay up if you don't want to play again
- +25 total XP for each player who engages with this encounter

**Riddle #2**
- "I have roads without travelers, I have mountains without trees, I have water without fish...What am I?"
- Answer: a map
- +50 total XP for each player who engages with this encounter

Hearty applause if you get the second one right
- He'll pay you the 20 silver with good humor, joking that he'll have to move on soon if everyone in this town is as clever as you.
- He'll start juggling oranges and telling a joke for the crowd as you move away

### Judgment on Escaped Pig

The blacksmith is listening to a neighborly dispute. He'll step to the side with you to pay out your share of the goblin loot (liquidated).
- 24 gold + 4 silver + 2 copper for each player plus 2 extra coppers to argue over

The blacksmith will go on to ask help settling this dispute. "These two always find things to argue about, but this one is a bit tricky."

**Dispute**
- Vesna owns the pig.  She's a stout woman in her 40s.
- Bratan owns the hayloft.  He's a stout man in his 40s. No relation.
- **Vesna**: "Bratan's hayloft collapsed on my prize pig, and broke the poor dear's leg. I can't put Custard out to stud as he his! Bratan owes me for the lost fees."
- **Bratan**: "Vesna's blundering pig escaped into my barn, running amok, and broke the hayloft support beam itself! Vesna owes ME for the repairs!"
- **Vesna**: "Bratan weakened the hayloft himself by scrounging wood from it to build his new cow shelter. I know his ways! He's a skinflint, he is! That loft was an accident waiting to happen!"
- **Bratan**: Humph! What I do with my lumber is my own business.

**Situation Details**
- Custard the pig escaped his enclosure by learning how to undo the gate latch.
- Bratan left his barn door open while going in and out for chores.
- Custard was rooting around in the barn to get at the apples stored there.
- In addition Bratan's removing some of the hayloft's support beams, dry rot has set into others. Custard (a very large pig) knocking about was enough to break one and then the whole thing fell down.
- Bratan over-estimates that he's suffered 2 gold of damages. Vesna expounds that Custard pulls very good rates but gives no specific amount.
- I verified that pigs mate in the fall.

There is no right answer to this encounter.
- If the players engage with the discussion, they'll get more XP  
- either way, you'll find out if your party is interested in this kind of encounter

(my party spent 20-30 minutes investigating and discussing judgments)

+50 XP for each player who engages with this encounter
- plus another 50 XP for each player if they come up with a 2-sided decision, not just in one person's favor

## Apothecary Shop

[Mistress Gurta](/Characters/Family_Aldag.md#Gurta)

[Apothecary Shop](/Locations/Town_Tunly.md#Apothecary_Shop)

![Trap map](/Locations/Images/Shop_Tunly_Apothecary_Scenario_003.png)
(svg [here](/Locations/Images/Shop_Tunly_Apothecary_Scenario_003.svg))
- No roll needed to spot the bear traps
- No roll needed to spot things on the ceiling, if you look for them
- DC 7 to spot the trip wires
- DC 10 to spot the pressure plates
- DC 18 to not slip on the slippery floor

Mistress Gurta will observe how your party handles the traps from the half-level-up balcony. She's likely to be critical.

Once all players are "dead", or you think Gurta would have ended it, move on to the conversation part

She's very judgmental about how many traps you fall into
- "You'll need more than that to buy these wares!"
- "In my day, adventurers could spot a pit trap a mile away!"

Gurta called you here to give you a magic item to help you defeat the [Autumnal Druid](/Characters/Druid_Meinrad_Ozga.md)
- "You think you're ready to face this man? Who binds evil spirits to scarecrows and commands the goblins?"
- "I was an adventurer myself for many many years, so I know what I'm talking about. That was before my first son was born, of course, such a fine young man he is now, and so many grandchildren he's given us. Not like his sister at all, no she was trouble from the start, that dratted girl. She's out in Upper Furdy last I heard, but that's not saying much, she doesn't ever write, does she? Ungrateful child. But where was I?" (this goes on as long as the party doesn't interrupt)
- "And he clearly favors sending puppets into the fray and keeping himself safe. You won't get an honest fight out of this man. That's why I called you here, to give you THIS."
- "This [Accusing Finger](/Items/Accusing_Finger.md) (holds up a shriveled finger in a small jar) will point the way to hidden foes, when you are close enough. I will lend this to your efforts because he has twice sent enemies against our town. Use it wisely, and RETURN IT once he is defeated!" She looks at you hard. "Do not forget to RETURN IT!"

How did you come by this item?
- "As I said, I've been an adventurer myself. Now run along, I must find my assistant to reset these traps."

How close do we need to be to the druid for this to work?
- "At less than five chains it should work. That's 300 feet for you."
- (a chain == 22 yards or 66 feet)

Will it work on any enemy?
- No, Gurta bound it to the Druid only, using items he left behind at the ritual site last night

(note which character will be carrying the jar in their inventory)

+75 XP for each player who engages with this encounter

## Starting into the Forest

(my party wanted to get started into the [Standing Forest](/Locations/Standing_Forest.md), following the treasure map from [Scenario 002](/Scenarios/002_Exploring_Around_Tunly.md)])

It is later afternoon. The forest is dense and only dim light filters in. There are no paths, even a few yards past the Mallow River ford.

DC 12 Nature or Survival check to stay on a due-east course.

### Rat Encounter

After an hour, two large rats jump out at you. (These are more to pause traveling so we can introduce the lake than to be a danger)

Rats (based on MM 335)
- HP 5 and 8
- AC 10
- Size 40 lbs
- Speed 20 feet
- STR(-4) DEX(0) CON(-1) INT(-4) WIS(0) CHA(-3)
- Darkvision 30 feet
- Passive perception 10
- Keen Smell: Advantage on Wisdom(Perception) rolls that involve smell.
- Bite Attack: Melee, +0 to hit, reach 5 feet, one target. 1 piercing damage on a hit.
- Challenge 0

The first rat is bold, the second hangs back and will run away afraid if you finish the first one off quickly.

### Introduce Hemlock Lake

[Hemlock Lake](/Locations/Standing_Forest.md#Hemlock_Lake)

A few yards past the rat encounter, you come to the shore of a quiet lake.

(players can explore and investigate the lake)
