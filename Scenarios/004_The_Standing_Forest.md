After fighting off two rats and fleeing hastily from the demon in the lake, you've lost track of time.
Is it very late at night, or early morning? You can't tell in this damned forest, where it's always dark. 
All you know is that you've been traveling all day, this forest seems only to look darker and sound creepier 
the deeper you go, and you wish you hadn't left town in the middle of the afternoon. 
The shadows keep moving at the edge of your vision, and the insects are relentlessly harassing you. Worse yet, every now
and then, you could swear you feel some unseen thing brush against your arm.

Just as you begin to see the glow of a distant fire, a sense of warmth, benevolence, and safety seems to be emanating,
reaching out toward you.

As these tired thoughts cloud your mind, just as you begin to see the glow of the distant fire that you're sure
marks your destination, you hear a singular, vicious howl pierce through the night—far too close for comfort.
You can't see it in the darkness, but it seems that something has caught your scent.
Milo, you immediately recognize this as the howl of a worg: a malevolent and viciously cunning predator that delights in
hunting and devouring creatures weaker than itself, and one that goblins often use as mounts.
Its call is immediately joined by several others, and shortly followed by a cacophony of shouts of alarm and 
thundering footsteps.
You recognize the language as goblin. It sounds like an entire army, and it's swiftly heading straight for you.
You're clearly vastly outmatched here.

##### If players stand and fight:
- The horde grows and grows. Arrows start raining down around them.
- If they still don't flee, then a will-o'-wisp lights the way.
- If they still don't flee, then the goblins capture them.
    - Goblins serving a hag who rules this part of the forest

##### If they flee:
Chase (following [alternate chase rules](https://www.matthewperkins.net/blog/2018/7/1/alternate-chase-rules) created
by Matthew Perkins)
- Each player rolls STR(Athletics) vs the pack of [Goblin Worg-Riders](/Creatures/Goblin_Worg-rider.md) (+0,
possibly with disadvantage because they're relying on smell instead of sight, though worgs have keen smell)
    - Advantage for speed >30 (Mundil); disadvantage for speed <30 (Milo)
- Barnabus and Bilge are likely to carry Milo and possibly Mundil. There are no penalties for this unless they reach
their encumbrance weight.
- After first success or failure:
    - "A large and mostly-decayed [fallen tree](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ca/b0/83/cab083b9a5ec4cfd42db76880bc4f8e0.jpg)
    lies directly in your path.
    The smaller folk could certainly run under it with ease, but you larger creatures have a decision to make.
    What do you do?"
        - DC 10: Athletics / Acrobatics to go over or under (small creatures can go under for free)
        - AC 10, 5 HP if they try to smash it (it's a weak decayed log)
            - If they smash it, a band of intelligent squirrels who were using the log as a __ later harass the party.
- Failures (each round, first shot fired at character who failed the worst, then each shot next up):
    1. "[Characters who failed], the rest of the party starts to pull ahead as you fall behind.
    The howls of the worgs grow noticeably louder.
    Pick up your pace and roll again."
    2. "You can now hear the shouts of individual goblins and the footfalls of the frontmost rider.
    You also hear a fleeting hiss
        - [as an arrow zips through the air next to you, narrowly missing your right shoulder.]
        - or
        - [, followed by a thud, before the pain of the arrow blazes out from your right shoulder.]
        
        - Aiming for character who failed worst, +4 to hit, disadvantage for range, 1d6+2 piercing
        - If hit, disadvantage on next chase roll. If character yells in pain, emphasize this to the rest of the
        party in hope that they'll help.
    3. "The worg-rider closest to you curses angrily and fires again.
    A red-hot pain sears through you as an arrow pierces your right shoulder." (pre-roll 18)
    You hear twang after twang as the other goblins come into range and loose their arrows." 
    Pre-rolls (7, 18, 5, 11)
        - 7, Left leg
        - 18, stomach
        - 5, left shoulder
        - 11, right hand
    4. ...
- Successes:
    1. "The sound of the horde grow somewhat fainter as you pull away from them.
    The feeling of safety and security from ahead grows stronger with each step.
    You're not there yet, though; keep running. Roll again."
    2. "As you pull farther away from the goblin army, you're starting to gain hope that you might make it to assured safety.
    The darkness gives way to a small clearing surrounding the fire. You're nearly there."
    3. "You sprint with all your might toward the light. The instant you cross into the clearing, the small campfire
    suddenly bursts to life, blazing up to a height of nearly five feet."
    
        
## Old druid camp
This blinding flash is accompanied by a disorienting quiet that you first mistake for silence.
But then a wave of tranquility washes over you.
You feel at ease, a strange lack of worry about the horde that was just on your heels, when you turn back and realize
that those goblins and worgs look stunned and perplexed.

They seem totally unconcerned about continuing their pursuit and are instead arguing amongst each other, the worgs
snapping their jaws as their riders squabble.

You realize that what you're hearing isn't silence, but merely the normal—albeit still pretty creepy—background noise
of the forest underneath the static crackling of the fire.

When you turn back toward it, the campfire has subsided, but only somewhat; it is now about the same height as Milo or 
Mundil.

The strangest part, though, is that the flames have taken the shape of an upside-down triangle with a crescent in the
middle. As you watch, it slowly morphs into a circle, then a V-shape, then a rectangle with a crescent, and more.
Milo, you recognize these as Druidic runes meaning "goblin", "evil", "safe", "orc", "troll", and so on.

- 60-foot radius around fire
- Arcana to identify (druids have advantage and automatically know that this is druidic magic:
    - DC 10: It appears to be some sort of magic.
    - DC 15: This looks like druidic magic to you.
    - DC 20: Magic like this could only have been accomplished by a very powerful druid.
    - DC 30: Several permanent enchantments have been placed here: one for the fire, another that is akin to an
     Antipathy spell against evil creatures.
- Investigation check on goblins / radius:
    - Their arguments have calmed somewhat, and the worgs are sniffing around absently.
    They all mill about, wandering vaguely back in the direction from which they came.
    - They seem to have forgotten you entirely.
- Investigation on fire itself:
    - Source is actually a carved-out section of boulder underneath the fire; has runes all over it.
    - While a tiny flame still burns as normal, the vast majority of the fire is actually floating slightly above the logs.
    - You notice that the logs are actually placed in a carved-out section of a huge boulder.
    Looking more closely, you see that runes have been carved all over this section—similar to the ones in the flames,
    but far more complex.
    - In morning: logs haven't burned down at all.
- Boulder too big to unearth.
- Regardless of your gear or preparations, you sleep soundly as long as you're within the campsite.

- Take torch from the fire with them? = 12 hours of goblin protection (or halfway between Cracked Rock and Arch Tree)

## Cracked Rock
After a few hours' of trekking, you spot your next landmark: a huge moss-covered boulder, split unevenly,
either half easily twice as tall as the largest of you.
    - [each half roughly 12' x 8' x 8', weighing hundreds of tons]
As you approach, you see a bare patch on the left boulder: in the middle is an arrow pointing up and left toward what
could loosely be called a path.
- Investigation DC 20 (15 for druid):
    - At the same height, the other boulder has a patch of moss hanging loose.
    Lifting it reveals more runes carved underneath, starting with the same arrow.
    The runes read: "[arrow] unsafe. Eagle shows the way."
        - [Speak With Animals spell](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:speak-with-animals) as an eagle reveals the true path,
        while also revealing the path to another safe camp.
- If anyone hits the rock hard enough, the moss patch falls to reveal the message.
- Speaking in the language of an eagle causes the runes to shift.
    - The arrow rotates to point southeast, and the runes conglomerate into the words for "sanctuary" and "camp".
    - <del>Then a new message scrawls itself beneath this: "That She may walk again."<del>

#### Travel
[After players make camp]
After half a day of travel, no more than ten feet from your intended path, you spot a ray of sun shining through the
treetops—something that is becoming more and more rare as you progress deeper into this part of the forest.
In the middle of the circle of light, you find a strange sight: exactly ten stones, carved with runes, neatly arranged
in an almost perfect three-foot-wide circle... except for one stone in the bottom-right that is just a few inches out
of place, outside the circle.
- These runes are not in a language any of you recognize.
- If you put it in place, a group of pixies appear just to push another stone out of place, whereupon they disappear again.

## Arch tree
It's early afternoon the day of your departure from your last campsite when you see it: a large tree in the middle
of a clearing, a 15-foot-tall, 10-foot-wide arch formed neatly . It's so broad that this arch takes up
barely a quarter of its width, and so tall that its canopy
There are no other trees around it, but the glade is full of wild grasses, herbs, and flowers, all blooming despite
the season. Their fresh, earthy smell carries on the breeze.

Investigation 10 / Perception 20: you see a green gem implanted in the ground in the center of the arch. [another at top of arch]
- Nature check: Banyan (fig) tree

A second after you first set foot in the glade, a THOCK to your right alerts you to an arrow that narrowly missed you.
Shortly after, another buries itself in the ground at your feet. [pre-rolls: 11 and 9]
Roll initiative. (Norric gets 13)

#### Norric:
Stealth (+3) vs Perception to find him.
"Stay away from the tree an' no one gets hurt!"
"Ah found it, an' that means it's mine! Ain't ya never heard'a honor among thieves?"

The moment you enter the archway, the world around you disappears, and in a moment of dizzying vertigo, is replaced by
a scene similar to where you were a second ago... but eerily different. 
You're facing outward, as if you ran straight through the archway.
The trees are more pine than deciduous
The flowers are all different, more purples and blues here, as opposed to the dominant reds and oranges of a few seconds ago.
Your friends are nowhere to be found.

The gem is now ruby instead of emerald.




- Arch Trees are all portals to each other; they are unassuming, if large trees whose only discerning feature is
a large arch in the roots or trunk which varies in size from 10x10 ft to 30x30 ft
    - Possibly [treants](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/treant)?
- By default, each tree leads to the next in geographic order.
- By speaking the name of a particular tree ([Speak With Plants spell](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:speak-with-plants)),
one can teleport to any tree.
    - This is the only way to reach the Center Sanctum Tree (working name; details later)
