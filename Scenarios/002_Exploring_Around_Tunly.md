## Summary
Your party has recovered the town's lost Jack-o'-lanterns and stopped the Autumnal Druid's nefarious plot—for now.

What will you do next?

## Intro

[Tunly Town](/Locations/Town_Tunly.md)

When last we saw our adventurers, the intrepid band of local heroes had just rescued 85.7% of the missing Jack-o'-lanterns,
in the process thwarting the Autumnal Druid's mysterious plot to get the Standing Forest moving again. Where will
this week's escapades take them? Stay tuned to find out!

In the town of Tunly, having been gifted a free night at the White Crow Tavern, you wake up shortly after sunrise to the
sound of children playing and laughing. The townsfolk are already bustling about, preparing for day two of the
festivities. The smell of pie and roasting meat fills the crisp autumn air.

What do you do?

##NPC Interactions
As they leave the inn, Sheriff Aldwin Lenski introduces himself and answers any questions the party might have.
Ends with, "I know the Heroes of the Lantern won't be causing any trouble, now will they?"
- (proud that he came up with that name himself; less so that he couldn't find the thief (he was following leads in
another part of town))

First person they ask for work:
- "Haha, you must be new to the mercenary life. A bit of advice, young ones: the best place to find a job is in a tavern."
Second person:
- "I heard Luca Frey is looking for some help on his farm. But you lot don't look much like the goat-milking sort...
'cept maybe that one" _points at Milo_

**Waldo Boruch, dry goods / sundries**
- Thanks party vehemently; doesn't remember promising them a discount.
- DC 15 persuasion = 5% off 1 item; DC 15 for 10%

**Yegor Lenski, young boy**
- Starts following you after you leave the inn. After first shop, DC 15 Perception to catch him each time you leave a shop.
- "Adventurers! I have a quest for you. But you have to _promise_ you'll keep it a secret." (DC 15 Charisma)
    - Fail: "Liar! You're gonna snitch!" He kicks you in the shin and runs off.
    - Pass: "I, uh... _found_ this map. And it leads to treasure, see! X marks the spot! But my parents would _kill_ me
    if I crossed the river. I'll give it to you for five, no ten gold! And half of the treasure!"
    - DC 15 CHA to talk him as low as 50 copper.
    - DC 15 CHA to get him to admit how he actually "found" the map.
    
**Beata Knapik, barmaid at The White Crow**
- "Can I offer you a White Crow? Popular with the younger adventurers these days."
- "If you're looking for work, the tavernkeeper is always willing to buy fetherfew. Ain't easy to find, grows in the
forest, but she'll pay good coin for it. Makes a wine like magic—tastes like grass, but a gal can drink a whole barrel
without fearin' no hangover."
    - If asked, Beata provides this information: "It's a plant with a buncha small white flowers, 'bout yay high"
    - DC 15 Nature Check: This herb grows to about 18 inches in height. It has many small white flowers. The flowers must
be dried and then boiled in white wine. The resulting mixture must be drunk. This herb will remove the effects of
vertigo from a person for up to twelve hours. It does this by stabilising the persons inner ear. You don't know how the
tavernkeeper uses it to completely nullify hangover.
- On your way out of the tavern, you see a handwritten note pinned to the wall: _Paying 1 silver per wolf pelt. See Luca Frey_ 

**Luca and Goramar Frey, farmers living north of the fields outside of town**
- "You saw my note in the tavern? We have some trouble with wolves out here, you see? Normally, my Goramar takes care
 of 'em, big strong man he is. Only we're both getting old and Gorrie here has a bum knee that's giving him extra
 trouble this year. Haven't seen too many of the bastards lately, thank Chauntea [chawn-TEE-ah], but I'll happily pay
 a silver for every pelt you bring me."
 
##Encounter—Goblins attack
After the party's first few conversations, or after they visit their first store, or when they try to leave town:
- You hear a scream, followed by a cacophony of shouting.
- People come charging through the town gate, screaming and crying.
- As you rush toward the gate, you hear battle cries and the clashing of swords.
- There's a small crowd rushing through the gate, pushing you backward, and you find it difficult to get through.
- DC 15 STR or DEX check; failure causes you to trip or get shoved, giving you disadvantage on the upcoming initiative roll.
- A horde of goblins is attacking! A party of five pure-white dragonborn with identical armor and shields fights a large
group, and the town guards and sheriff are fending off a few. Those that slip past come straight for you. 

- Roll initiative.
- Attacking party: 4 niblins and 4 pitiful goblins
- At the beginning of combat, all 4 niblins throw their daggers (with disadvantage due to range, likely missing)
- After round 2, you hear the town gate close. Shortly after, two heavy crossbow archers join the fight from behind the wall (standing on landings built for this purpose).
- Sometime during round 3, you hear a thunderous roar. If you chance a look, you see two of the dragonborn breathing
a misty white cloud, resembling something like snow or white fire, which freezes solid several of the goblins.
- Too easy? Throw in another goblin or two. Too hard? One of the archers gets a lucky shot.
- If a player drops below half health, one of the dragonborn clerics heals them: (DC 10 PER to see where it came from)
    - "You feel a warm tingle course through your body, and your wounds start to stitch back together"
    - Each has:
        - 1 use of channel divinity (distribute 10 HP among any # of targets w/in 30 ft)
        - 3 uses of Healing Word (2d4+1 to one target w/in 60 ft)
- As combat draws to a close (one or two goblins left), the town gates open, and a crowd swarms out—all armed, but not
exactly rushing into battle. They're led by a man and woman with heavy crossbows [Reinhardt and Beata], the mayor close
behind them.

##After the fight:
Sheriff: "The forest goblins have never so much as crossed the river, let alone attack us! What's going on here?"

One of the dragonborn [Muumtindrish] responds, "We're following the trail of a certain druid who has been disturbing
the peace. A human. Have you seen him?"

If pressed for an intro: "We are the Katimai—Servants of Bahamut. But there is no time for introductions."

"We have been tracking the druid southward since he left Mirn Thurum. Whatever he is doing, certain residents of the
forest do not like it." He turns to your party, "You fight well against the servants of Tiamat. We could use your
strength in taking down the man causing this disturbance. Come with us."

The mayor argues that they need strong adventurers here to protect the town.

As they speak, more and more townsfolk gather around, all of them armed. It seems like nearly the entire town is now
joining the fight, just a little too late. As they mill about, some graciously thanking you for saving them, others
keeping a vigilant eye on the forest, the closest adventurer feels something slip into their hand. They look down to see a
rolled-up piece of paper. Roll perception.
- DC 15. Pass: you meet the eyes of a young boy. He gives you a stern look, nods once, then does his best to get lost
in the crowd until some adults catch him and usher him home, scolding, "Yegor, what are you doing out here?! It isn't safe!"
- Fail: in the crowd of people, you can't pick out who slipped you the note.

Fyodor: "Daivian and I will go check on Luca and Goramar. Keep the gates shut until we get back."

**Town**

If the players decide to stay in town, Yegor Lenski later asks Milo, "Did you get my map?"
Sheepishly explains that he found it when he was practicing with his slingshot and "accidentally" shot a messenger hawk.

**Frey Farm**

Luca and Goramar Frey have no idea about the battle. After two attempts at knocking, Luca answers, poking only his head
around the door. While talking to him, Goramar approaches, totally naked, bruskly asking who's interrupting, then shutting
the door on you. They listen briefly if you mention wolves.

**The Standing Forest**

At the forest's edge, you see that a vague path has been stamped down by years of people entering at this exact spot, but it curiously fades and then disappears after only 50 feet or so.
Day 1 in the forest requires a DC 15 Survival check to avoid getting lost. Each day, the DC goes up 1.

If the players reach the Arch tree, they encounter Norric, who has been living here for weeks in a hidden camp. DC 25
persuasion or DC 20 intimidate to get him to leave the treasure.

Random forest encounters:
1. Just off to one side, it isn't a clearing, but the trees are somewhat less dense surrounding a small apple tree. It's full of fruit: perfectly ripe, red-yellow apples. (just a normal tree)

24. DC 13 DEX to avoid spiked pit trap. If you fall in, a grizzled half-orc ranger rushes in to help, offers you a

that he just likes to be left alone. If you help anyway, he

their domain without permission.

appear just to push another stone out of place, whereupon they disappear again.
28. A hunter with a huge longbow strapped to his back.  The hunter tells the party his name and that he is looking to
hunt the most dangerous game in the lands.  The next morning the party finds an insidious note left at their camp during
the night saying that the hunt is on.  Over the next few days the party finds hunting traps meant for them.


Random road encounters:

5. A carriage approaches. When it approaches, the driver yells to clear the way, even if you already have. As it passes,
you see the symbol of a noble house on the side.
6. A farmer going to the Tunly market with his meager goods. He sells the worst looking, yet best tasting apples one
could ever find.  He doesn't know why his orchards produce such odd fruit.  Any player who eats an apple is healed for
1d4-1 hit points.  A player healed must also roll a 1d4.  On a one they suffer one point of exhaustion.
7. A farmer returning from town with his three daughters is seen on the side of the road huddled beneath their damaged
cart.  The family has been attacked by a swarm of stirges as the evidenced by the presence of a stirge, bludgeoned
with a shovel.  The family asks the party to escort them the remainder of the way home.  Their home is an hours walk out
of the way for the party and an hour is needed to fix the cart.
8. A young girl is found sitting alone on the side of the road.  Barefoot and hungry, she wishes to stick with the party
until the next town where she can find safety.  Her intentions are to wait until a second adventuring party of equal or
greater skill pass by and beseech them to save her.  She will say to them that she has been kidnapped by the players and
that they have stolen her gold.  Unless persuaded otherwise, the adventurers believe the girl’s story.
9. A young boy is found intent on running away to the city.  He is small and would surely lose a fight to even the
lowliest of goblins.  Yet he begs and pleads to become an adventurer and join the party on their quest.
10. A lost child is found in tears and holding a torn sack.  While the child is not injured the vegetables he carried
are completely ruined and smashed into the dirt.  He was picked on by neighborhood children while returning home from
the market with his family’s supper.  His parents will surely be upset if he returns empty handed.
11. A troupe of entertainers, led by an overdressed and curious Elf.  The Elf is a ring leader in a traveling circus of
sorts and is always looking for new and exciting acts for his traveling performances.  The Elf will pay top gold for any
such acts or items that he can use in his shows.
12. A small group of mercenaries, dishevelled and sweating.  Their group was recruited to help defend a town from
goblins.  When the reports of goblins turned out to be instead a warband of savage Orcs, these few mercenaries ran away
leaving the others greatly outnumbered.  Although the mercenaries will not tell the truth of how they were cowards, a
week later the party over hears rumors of the incident and the cowardice of some of the mercenaries.
13. A pair of hunters are arguing about who is to blame for a missed shot.  They both claim to be the better marksman.
They ask the party to judge their skill and each shoot at a notch on a tree fifty yards away.  After they both land the
shot perfectly the party is asked to say who is better.  If the party picks one over the other the party is given a gold
piece by the victor.
14. A lone trader on foot, leading a mule carrying his wares.  He warns the party of a group of men hiding in ambush at
the bridge a quarter mile up the road and how they had let him go because he has nothing of value.  While there is a
bridge down the road there are no thieves hiding in ambush.  The man is simply a liar and tells tales for laughs.
15. A limping bailiff and his badly beaten prisoner are walking down the road.  The man is being returned to jail for
theft and assaulting a member of justice.  The prisoner claims that he was only stealing bread to avoid starvation and
was defending himself from an overzealous bailiff.  The prisoner swears on his honor that if the party pays his fine of
25 gold pieces that he will stay with the group to work off the debt by being the party’s servant.  He originally offers
his services for one gold per day but is willing to haggle.  If the fine is paid the prisoner stays with the party for
only half of any agreed time before attempting to run away in the night.
