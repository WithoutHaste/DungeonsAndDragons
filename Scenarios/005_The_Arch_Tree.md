## Recap
The Heroes of the Lantern earned their name after saving the harvest festival in the town of Tunly.
A mysterious figure calling himself the Autumnal Druid had stolen the town's jack-o-lanterns and was
    using them for a ritual outside of town.
After returning the jack-o-lanterns to the townspeople, our heroes spent a day mingling in Tunly, where they
    met Mayor Bertram, Sheriff Aldwin, Gurta the apothecary, and others.
Beata, the barmaid at the White Crow, informed the party that the tavernkeeper is willing to pay for the herb
    featherfew to make a famous hangover-free wine, while the farmers Luca and Goramar Frey offered a few gold
    for any wolf pelts they happen to acquire.
Soon after, a horde of goblins attacked the town! With help from a passing party of Dragonborn paladins and
    Fyodor the town guard, the heroes defeated the goblins. In the chaos of the post-battle crowd, a note
    was slipped into Milo's hand, but she horribly failed her perception check and couldn't track down the
    source.
While the Dragonborn paladins offered to travel south with the party, following the path of the druid, our
    Heroes decided instead to follow the map found on this mystery note.
After three days of facing the horrors of the forest——from giant rats to starving bears, more goblins, and
    an ancient demon locked away at the bottom of a lake——as well as the strange runes and fire along the
    map's trail——we have found the X at the bottom of the map:
The so-called Arch Tree, a 40-foot-tall gnarled tree with more roots than trunk, standing in the middle of
    a glade, surrounded by blooming flowers despite the season. The middle section of the roots form tight knots
    around a 20-foot-tall, 15-foot-wide archway, at the center of which floats a green gem the size of a halfling's
    head.
Upon stepping foot into the glade, the party was attacked by a figure hiding in the woods. Arrows were fired from the
    cover of the trees until Mundil spotted the assailant, a stocky halfling with a crossbow. Practically flying across
    the glade, Mundil turned the ranged assault into a melee, and the halfling drew his swords to fight.
The slippery bastard seems to evade most of the blows aimed at him——particularly those of a certain large,
    warhammer-wielding tiefling——but he screamed in rage when Mundil approached the gem.
Mundil stepped into the archway and immediately found himself stepping out the other side, to a similar-but-not-identical
    glade, where he found that the gem floating in the archway was now red, and his friends were nowhere to be seen or
    heard. Mundil has just stepped through again and felt the familiar vertigo of taking a ten-foot-long step out the
    other side.

Meanwhile, the rest of the party continues to try to take down the halfling. It is Bilge's turn.


If they knock Norric down, he begs for his life. If he's still standing, he pulls out a bottle of alchemist's fire.
    [disengages, then pulls out a glass bottle with thick red liquid inside]
    "Don't come any closer! This here's alchemist's fire, and I swear I'll burn you all up!"

## Norric after his defeat:
Now that he's [standing/laying] still, you get a better look at him: quite a bit older than Milo, but not as old as Mundil.
    Stockier than either, and darker-skinned. In addition to the cuts and bruises you've inflicted on him, he's got an
    old scar running down one cheek. He's covered in dirt and twigs... [If they're close enough] And he smells... ripe.

He looks up at you and says,

"Whoa, whoa, slow down. Perhaps I was a bit too hasty. Now, why don't we talk about this like civil folk?"

"Don't kill me, please, I'll give you anything! What do you want? Gold, weapons, information, anything!"

"Hey, you were the ones fightin' the pumpkin monsters a while back, weren'tcha?! We're on the same side!"

[glancing at Mundil's vestments and/or Barnabus' holy symbol]
"You look like a lawful bunch. You wouldn't just kill a man in cold blood, wouldja?"

"No, no, wait, I work for the city watch!" [Captain of the Watch Halder Goldworthy up in Mirn Thurum]

"I'm a detective. This here's an official investigation in the city of Meern Thurum. But don't go tellin' no one,
it's real secret-like. Undercover stuff."
- Insight DC [rolled to gm only]
    - <15: he's shaking from the violence of a fight, but he sounds genuinely afraid for his life
    - 15: he's shaking and there's a tremor in his voice, but then, 
            he [*was* nearly killed / *does* have an angry group facing him down]
    - 20: he's shaking, there's a tremor in his voice... and he can't seem to maintain eye contact
    - 25: 
    - If you catch him, "I swear, it's true!"
    - Charm / Intimidation / etc. DC 13 to get him to admit, "Well, not exactly a detective... see, there's some of
            us that the Captain trusts. pays us to tell her what we see on the streets, see. and in return, she...
            turns a bit of a blind eye to some of our less law-abidin' tendencies."

"What do you want to know?"
    "The tree there, it's one-a-them magic doors-to-someplace-faraway." [Yeah, a portal!]

"Look, could you let me stand? We can talk about this like civil folk."

"Can I ask you somethin' first?"

### Map
"How'd you come by that map?"
"Here in Tunly... Oh no, not Ol' Hawkie... poor girl's prob'ly dead in some lowlife criminal's belly. No honor these days, shootin' down
    another man's bird."


### Druid
I've been tailing this guy for a while. Captain got word of some druids causing real trouble, said she'll pay *triple*
    for any information on 'em. [puffs out his chest / looks proud] And wouldn't you know, the ol' Goldworthy luck strikes
    again, and I happen to stumble upon those very druids one night when I was, uh, hunting. [trying to steal a cow
    on the outskirts of a farm]

Thought it was odd, there bein' a group of people way out there at dark with no campfire. I commenced to eavesdroppin' 
    and found that the Autumnal fella—that's the one that you met, the "Autumnal Druid" he calls himself—was teachin' some
    kinda ritual to the other three. Had himself a big fancy spellbook and all.

I didn't catch all of what he said, but what I gather is they're looking for trees like this one. They've got old magic
    in 'em, the druid says, only it's——what'sat word for magic what ain't workin'?
            Yeah, de-spelled! / dormint-like.
            Sleepin.
    Anyway, cult-y stuff and all, but I don't think they're lookin' for  trouble. Kept talkin' real happy to each other,
    'bout savin' the forest and all.
   
I'da taken all that information back to the Captain of the Watch, 'cept right about then, our mutual acquaintance pulled out 
    a sack full'a gems and started handin' 'em out like candy at the harvest festival.

After that, they split ways, and him seemin' like the fella in charge—what with havin' all the gems——I followed
    him down to Tunly, where y'all ran into him.
    While you were fightin' those pumpkin monsters, he slinked off into the woods, and I kept to the shadows and
    followed him. Wasn't easy keepin' close to him without gettin' caught, but [proudly] you're lookin' at the best
    detective in the city.


### Tree
It's one-a-them doors-to-a-faraway-place. [yeah, a portal!]

That druid fella took a little em'rald and planted it under this here tree like it was a seed and said himself another prayer,
    and the tree sprouted into this huge thing and pushed all the other trees outta the way to make this here clearin'.
    Then the emerald floated back up outta the ground, only now it's the size'a my head. We got wizards and all in the city, but I ain't
    never seen magic like this.

I been out here ever since, tryin'ta get that gem——you know, to report back to the Captain——and ain't been able to figure
    it out yet. Every time you go to grab it, you're comin' out the other side.
    I even tried hackin' the bastard down 'bout a fortnight ago, but my hatchet didn't do nothin'! Didn't leave a mark...
    'Cept you won't believe what happened next...
    Giant spiders started pourin' right outta the tree! [waits for a reaction]
        - Exactly! Some weird, powerful magic workin' here.
        - ...But I suppose that don't surprise a powerful adventurin' group like you.
    Anyway, I, uh, retreated myself to safety——can't have a *city employee* gettin' injured on the job, you know——
    and that's when I sent Ol' Hawkie with that note and map to the Captain.
  
I camped out here waitin' for 'em to show up, but after a few days, the spiders started disappearin'
and i took to investigatin', and I found somethin':
- [He leads you to the other side of the portal.]
- "Now, these two trees are identical, 'cept for this one's got a ruby 'n' th'other one has an em'rald, right? But look
here: [points to a low section near the portal's entryway] See that scar right there? That's right where I was hackin'
with my hatchet... only on the other tree!


### Why didn't you attack the druid?
I ain't no common thief no more! I'm a de-tective of the city, proper and law-abidin'! Captain pays me to fetch dirt—er,
    [slowly] "gather intel", not to get inta fights.  ...Plus, he always has them plant monsters all 'round him,
    even when he sleeps.
    - Why did you attack us? "You... you were obstructin' justice! This here's an official investigation by the city
    of Meern Thurum!"


#### Norric's inventory (under a lean-to covered in leaves):
- Crossbow & 30 bolts
- Two shortswords
- One dagger
- 20 days worth of rations
- coin pouch: 27gp, 30 sp
- One hatchet
- Pair of dice
- Deck of playing cards
- Bedroll
- Four empty sacks
- Spiked leather armor

### Getting the gem:
- "How about you take one and I take the other?"
- "Look, I haven't been livin' the best life in the city. And if I come back with something valuable, they'll just arrest
    me and take it. There's gotta be someplace else on the other side, right? Maybe someplace where I can start over.
    You hit this one and I'll hit the other."
- "I'll take that one and start a new life wherever it takes me. I'll spend some of my fortune to buy a new messenger
    hawk, and if I find anything about this druid, I'll send word back to the Captain."



..."...Hey, you're a druid, right? I saw that Autumnal fella take a log outta this creepy campfire he had and kept it
goin' longer'n' any torch has a right to. Could you do somethin' like that?
... What if we try burnin' 'em down? Gems are tough to fire, but wood ain't. I, uh, seen enough 'accidents' to know that."


"You take this gem and go to the Captain in Meern Thurum. Tell her everything I said, and she'll pay you more gold than
    you've ever seen! You'll be a hero!"




























































Norric works for network of sorta-spies: trusted narcs who sell info to Captain Dragongrip,
    who is secretly Lady Brightstone's spymaster.



Heard 'em talkin
There's a bunch'a spots like this. 
Find the spot, stick a gem in the ground, do a ritual, up sprouts a portal-tree

Ley lines







### Gold
There's a guy in Mirn Thurum that'll pay real nice for the dirt I got on this druid fella.
### Weapons
### Information
#### Short version:
Guy's got this cult. Real noble cause, tryin' to save the forest and all.
This here tree's one-a-them doors-to-a-faraway place.

There's some kinda old magic here, somethin' to do with these trees.
Twelve of 'em, they said, all portals to each other.
'Cept they're all... what'sat word for magic what ain't workin'?
    Yeah, de-spelled! / dormint-like.
    Sleepin.
They're trying to [re-spell/re-magic all of 'em / wake 'em all up].
Summon [some mispronounced god or demon] to put the spring back in ol' Woodsy's step.
They got most of the eastern ones where there's less people, but these trees ain't easy to find.
Our mutual acquaintance has a way of locatin' 'em. Got himself a fancy spellbook.
He gets near enough round the edge of the forest, does some kinda ritual, and somehow he knows the way.
Seen him do it up in Meern Thurum before hightailin' it down to Tunly.
Nearly lost 'im when his damned 
Walks right up to that magic fire, never-you-mind bout none of the dangers of this forest.


#### If pressed for more: [e.g. "How do you know all this?", intimidation, charm]
I been tailin' him for a while. 
There's a man up in Meern Thurum that pays good coin for information, and word got around that he's payin' extra for 
    dirt on a certain druid who pissed off some nobles.
Well just my luck I happened to be hunting in the woods one night and overheard Mr. Autumn and his buddies talking
    around the campfire.
Kept talkin' about savin' the forest, gettin' her to walk again.


But what caught my 



offers them info they can sell to spymaster if they let him keep the gem
gives them [a badge thingy? a password? both?] to give to spymaster to show that they're legit (probably a trap)

Best I can tell, this one ends up in __place__.

Thought about lootin' him or killin' him, but __spy dude__ cut off the you-know-what of the last guy who fucked with one of his targets.



pickpocketed nice gem from druid, so followed him. 
- still has this, but will lie and say he sold it in Tunly
was spying on him when he gave a speech to some other druids, something about making the forest walk again
something about a small fortune

something about awakened the Western tree

something about awakening the magic of the elders. (norric thinks he's batshit crazy)

other druids laughed him off, saying that all that stuff is old wive's tales, myths and legends

norric has been following him ever since. hard to track, was always a bit behind him.
druid keeps summoning things to 
saw him perform his ritual outside tunly.
while y'all were fightin' pumpkins, i followed the sneaky devil into the woods
tried to rob him in his sleep, but he had this creepy fire with some kinda invisible wall 'round it
made me forget what i was even doin' out here. spent a night in this spooky woods trying to remember
without getting killed by pissed-off goblins.
then i reached into my bag and found that gem. 
that's when i remembered the druid and started tracking him again

[fires only block certain creatures]

"Even when he sleeps, he's got them creepy crawly plants all 'round him"
"I figured I couldn't kill him outright, so I'd have to wait til I could get my hands on that magical fortune"

i caught up with him here. he was doin' some kinda ritual.

saw gem; has been trying to figure out how to take it ever since.
sent message to his old gang.
tried chopping tree [either grows back or inflicts on you whatever dmg you inflict on it]

- why did he take on the party singlehanded? got cocky and overestimated his abilities
- 





[if they try to kill him, he offers gold]
[or if they kill him, it's all in a note to his brother]

- Look, I got caught up with this group, see? Real secret-type.
[Callin' themselves The Order of the Walking Forest.]
Seemed like they had a good cause, savin' the forest and all. But even better, they paid me real nice.
Seems they had need of a master thief like me, ta steal 'em that there em'rald.
Said they needed fer some kinda spell. Said just til the equinox, then it'd be mine.
[he doesn't mention the gold they're paying him. Promised to keep handin' out the gold as long as I watched over it for 'em.]
'Course, I didn't trust the bastards, so I figured I'd off with it. they didn't tell me that the damn thing's cursed.



- Norric was hired/blackmailed by a group of druids to use __magic item (smaller gem?)__ to notify him 
if anyone tried to disturb the Arch Tree.
- "'E bound me and tried ta blindfold me so's I couldn't see, but ya can't fool ol' Norric.
Fearin' for mah life, I mem'rized the way.
- I tried to escape, but that fucker put some kinda curse on me. If I get too far from
that damned tree, I start spittin' up blood. Happens if'n I go through the tree, too.
- Thought I's gon' die, 'til the food started showin' up. 'bout every tenday, a fresh pack'a ___ started comin' outta
the tree.
- Druid told me it's just til the equinox, then i'd be free. then we'd all be free. 

- only I figured I'd rather git the hell outta here with 

 and drawed that there map.
- Mah plan was to escape
I sent it with ol' Hawkie ta fetch m'brother Haldr, see, good lass can always find me'n'him,
bein' twins as we are.
Only she didn't make it, which means that somethin' happened to the poor girl.

If party mentions hearing hawk sounds, he whistles to call Hawkie down.
- "Most everybody knows 'bout hawk's good eyes, but ain't everyone know 'bout their
good ears too"

Hawkie shows up with note from Haldr "norric, if yo git this, i aint far bahind. folowin hawkie ta find ya after she 
showd up emty"

if pressed, he reveals that the druid has been sending him gold, too. if *really* pressed, he'll give it up.
treasure: gold, healing potions, 

- tried to escape after seeing the creepy fire, but ran into a horde of goblins

- hear whimpering, find that norric has pet wolf pup? 

druids kept saying "that she may walk again". norric smugly says that he figured out what they're talking about

- autumnal druid came by a few days ago. didn't even stop to say hello, just sprinted 
through on his __mount?__

norric overheard "halfway there"




if gem removed, tree dies?
gems only placed/removed at solstice/equinox?
gem placed and tree/portal sprouts up? or tree is already there? or both are already there and druid reactivates?

"Look, I'm a simple man. I just wanna be filthy stinkin' rich."




quest: have to save a trapped wolf pup. party will probably keep it.
it has a spell cast on it that lets the druids see and hear what it senses, so it can spy on the party.






flowers in glade indicate next portal?

### Norric's bag:
- NO healing potions
- __ gold
- 20 days rations


## If they try attacking the tree:
- Deals equal damage back to them.
- Begins slowly healing before their eyes.
- If they attack together, all damage hits one person chosen at random.
- Norric, arrogantly: "Yeah, I learned that the hard way, too.
Damn near broke my shootin' arm, too. 'S the only reason you were able to take me."

## Through the portal:

Options:
- back to tunly / to spymaster in mirn thurum
- through the portal
- try to get the gem
    - how are gems removed?
    - norric suggests they all start hacking at the tree at the same time.
    - "he did some kinda ritual to get it in there. maybe there's some kinda ritual to get it out. i bet it's all in that book of his"
- gather herbs:
    - "What do you want to do?"
        "Gather herbs!"
        "Any specific reason?"
        "No, just want to gather them."
        "Well, with your roll of 17, you find a good amount of herbs. Perhaps you can sell them to an apothecary in the next town for 3-4 gold pieces."

        or

        "I want to find enough to make a healing salve."
        "With your roll of 19, you find enough materials to create two uses of a Healer's Kit"
        or
        "With your roll of 7, you find a few common varieties in this area, but to manage something usable you'll have to either venture into the forest or buy the remaining materials for 1-2 gold pieces in the next village."

### Bounty on Norric: 25 gp alive, 20 dead
### Sheriff Aldwin recognizes him
