# Scenario 006: Captured By Bandits

Intended for:
- 4 players at Level 3

Goals:
- Present a situation that requires stealth and caution - a gauntlet
- (temporarily) Take away the resources the party is used to having
- Retcon some information from previous sessions
- Remove some of this excess wealth

Setting: [Albena's Bandit Hideout](/Locations/Albena_Bandit_Hideout.md)  

Author: Without Haste

## Summary

In an unskippable scene, our heroes are captured by bandits shortly after retrieving the emerald from under the Arch Tree. The bandits have been lying in wait for someone to get that gem for a while, so tonight they celebrate before heading home. They keep the party alive and tied up, planning to use them tomorrow as a distraction for getting past an owlbear den that is between here and the edge of the forest.

The party can stealthily explore the hideout, learn some new information, and escape. The bandits are strong enough to make it unlikely the party can win back the gemstone.

## DM Knowledge

**Information to fit into NPC responses and exposition**
- The party has been captured by bandits
- The party is still alive because they will be owlbear bait tomorrow
- The portal tree belonged to the Fae
- Norric can read minds (Detect Thoughts) and is a liar
- The Druid is looking for more powerful evil-aligned creatures for his ritual

Norric
- 2nd level Bard, 2nd or 3rd level Rogue
- 2nd level Bard spell Detect Thoughts let him learn about the Druid, he lied about the rest and made mistakes about the timeline

Arch Tree portal(s)
- created by the Fae

Bandits
- knock you out powered Essence of ether, an inhaled poison
```
Essence of ether, an inhaled poison
Inhaled Poison: These poisons are powders or gases that take Effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its Effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding oneâ€™s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.
```
- Albena knows Norric's sister, so she's letting him come back with the band, and is getting his injuries patched up today.
- There is a owlbear den between the bandit hideout and the nearest edge of the forest. To the north are goblins and to the south are bogs. They plan to use you all as a live distraction for the owlbear(s) so they can get home fast.

Autumnal Druid Meinrad Ozga
- Meinrad remembers your group by sight, and is annoyed at you're [Session 1 interference](/Scenarios/001_Tunly_Harvest_Festival.md), but he'd already realized that his ritual was going to fail. He attributes this to the poor quality of evil soul he was using (from evil animals the bandits sold him) and possibly that he was outside the forest's bounds.

## Unskippable Intro

You have acquired the emerald-under-the-tree, burning the great tree and its many spiders to the ground in the process. The emerald is cracked, but still worth _quite_ a lot of gold. The glade around you is shriveling up and drying out.

You begin backtracking the way you came here, wanting to put a little distance between yourselves and any left-over spiders before you camp.

Suddenly, a cloud of fine powder descends from the tree limbs above, and you quickly lose consciousness.  

Mundil (the monk in our party) receives a dream from his god:  
```
Mundil, you dream that you are in a place of light, and you hear a great voice.

It says, "Mundil Toos, listen well. Great evil is brewing in this forest. In the age of Emmantiensien, spirits filled the forest and it strode across the mountains and the cities of men alike. The spirits that once moved this forest have long since departed, and though they caused great destruction, they were neutral in their hearts. 

"But now one seeks to re-awaken the forest, and they do so with evil souls. If they succeed, all those who live in the forest and all who live in its path will know only terror and death. Heed my words, Mundil Toos, before it is too late."
```
As the voice and light fade away, you drift back into unconsciousness.

## Players Start

(it is now about midnight)  
(the party starts in Level B2 Room A)  
(the unconsciousness counted as a long rest)  

When you all wake up, you find yourselves lying on the floor in a small root cellar
- you've been stripped of your gear (armor, weapons, everything but clothing)
- there is a single young guard sitting on a stool by the door (Macar)
- you are all bound hand and foot, with hands behind your backs, by hempen rope

Macar: "Awake already? They really went cheap on that Ether. Well, at least I have someone to guard now."

DC 18 STR to break the ropes binding your hands
- this tightens the ropes, add 2 to DEX wriggle check up to max of 18

DC 18 DEX to wriggle out of the ropes binding your hands and feet
- lowers by 2 for each action of wriggling to loosen the ropes

### Macar

Macar is **Bandit Type 1 Template**. 15yo human boy.

Angry that he's on guard duty instead of at the feast.

Can be talked into leaving:
- Appeal to his vanity and the unfairness of the situation and how harmless you all are. Use your Persuasion(Charisma). He starts at DC 12, and the DC lowers by 2 for each convincing argument he listens to.
- If he goes to the feast, he will come back in about 15 minutes with food/drink in hand and another bandit for company.

If you fight him, he's cocky and can take a beating. Throws himself into fights.

Will give any one of you a sharp whack with his club (1 HP damage) whenever you try to get out of your bonds.

(Our party captured him, and won his loyalty by treating him respectfully and bringing him back food and drink. He gave them useful information about the layout of the building, and is still with them at the end of the session.)

## The Feast

(Most of the bandits are feasting the hall. They are very noisy. One Type 2 and 1 Dog are in the kitchen.)

(Occasionally, at the DM's discretion, a few of them can walk around the building to make the situation more precarious. If many of them disappear, that will alert the others that something is wrong.)

Bandit numbers:
- Type 1 (1/8 Challenge): 8 (count includes Macar)
- Type 2 (1/4 Challenge): 3
- Dogs (1/4 Challenge): 3
- Type 3 (1/2 Challenge): 2 
- Chief: 1 (Albena)

(Norric is there, but will not be fighting. He's just been patched up from what Barnabas put him through, and wants to eat and sleep.)

(You can fight, and even defeat, Albena.)  

(You cannot fight the Druid - he will slip away invisibly not matter what you do. But as long as he is safe, he will aid the bandits in a fight.)  

### Albena and Druid

(The Druid happens to be visiting the bandits today. He does not know who has been captured.)  
(You can overhear Albena and the Druid talking by listening at the kitchen service hatch, across from the head table.)

```
Druid: (irritated) Those animals you sold me were worthless! My ritual would have failed, even if some yockels hadn't interrupted me. Can't you catch something stronger?

Albena: No dice, we're packing it in. Got what we came for, so it's back to the city for us. Look here, pretty ain't it?

Druid: (shocked) You didn't take that yourself- ?!

Albena: Course not. Think we want the Fae after our heads? Some other idiot got it, and we took it off them. Easy as pie.

Druid: Very clever. Think you could clever me up a proper Yeti or better yet a Salamander?

Albena: You can look at what we got out back. Otherwise your out of luck.
```

(the Druid is seeking Evil aligned creatures to use in his forest-waking ritual)

(If you are discovered by Albena and Druid, the Druid can jump to the conclusion that Albena is in cahoots with you)
```
Druid: That's the group of mud-kickers who ruined my ritual! Why, your in cahoots with them!
```

## How Did It Go For Our Party?

They won Macar's loyalty and befriended the magpie. They killed 3 bandits + 1 dog by stealth.

They ended up fighting _all_ the bandits at once by shooting into the feasting hall (Norric is dead). I had the bandit chief still trying to capture them alive so the party wouldn't just die.

The bandit chief called off the fight after a handful of bandits were killed, cutting her loses and simply leaving since they have the gemstone and all the party's gold.

The Druid used his magic to help the bandit chief escape. After he Summoned four worgs, the party finally gave up and barricaded themselves in the kitchen. The bandits and druid all left, leaving the party in possession of the hideout. Macar hid in the kitchen with the party.

The party hasn't explored the vermin-infested B2 level yet.  And one player is leaving the party.

Albena Bandit Chief escaped with the gold and the emerald
- and 1 dog
- and 1 type 3 bandit
- and 4 type 1 bandits
- and 1 magpie

The party earned 675XP each and 39copper + 13silver total.
