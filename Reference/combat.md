# Combat

**Round**: Each participant in combat gets one turn per round. A round takes about `6 seconds` in-game time.

**Turn**: One participant gets one turn per round of combat. (More below)

**Turn Order**: Determined at the beginning of combat. All participants roll initiative, and those with the higher initiative go before those with lower initiative (**Initiative Order**). This order remains the same for the whole combat.
- If player characters tie, they decide amongst themselves who goes first.
- If NPCs tie, the DM decides who goes first.

**Roll Initiative**: Make a DEXTERITY check. Be default, the DUNGEON MASTER rolls once for an entire group of identical enemy NPCs.

**Surprise**: If DEXTERITY(STEALTH) exceeds the PASSIVE PERCEPTION of opposing characters, then you can make a surprise attack. Surprise is not possible without an attempt at stealth.
- If you are SURPRISED
  - No movement or action for your first turn in combat.
  - No reaction until your first turn in combat ends.
- SURPRISE is checked for each character, so some can be surprised while others are not.

**Space**: The region of map that a creature controls. See [Size Categories](/Reference/size_categories.md).

## Step-by-Step

1) Determine surprise  
2) Establish positions  
3) Roll initiative  
4) Takes turns (repeat in initiative order until combat ends)  

## Turn

**Move**: You can move up to your SPEED. If SPEED is 35 feet, then you can move 0 to 35 feet.

**Action**: You can take one action.

**Bonus Action**: If a class feature, spell, or ability says you can take it as a bonus action, then you can take it as an additional ACTION on your turn. You are limited to 1 bonus action per turn.

You can order MOVE, ACTION, and BONUS ACTION as you like (provided no other rules disallows it).  
You can split your MOVE up to before and after your ACTION.  
You can split your MOVE up between ATTACKS, if your ACTION includes multiple ATTACKS.  
You can skip any part of your turn.  

Other things you can mix into your turn:
- Brief communication, by speech or gesture.
- Interaction with 1 object or environmental feature.
  
The DM can decide if something requires your ACTION for the turn. Here are examples of usually-allowed interactions: • Open a door during MOVE • Draw your weapon during ACTION to attack • Hand an item to another character • Getting a potion out • Pick up a dropped weapon, or a torch from a sconce • Take a bauble off the table, or a book from a shelf (within reach) • Remove a ring from your finger • Stuff some food in your mouth, or down a flagon • Plant a banner in the ground • Fish a few coins from your belt pouch • Throw a lever • Extinguish a small fire • Don a mask • Pull on or take off your hood • Put your ear to a door • Kick a small stone • Turn a key in a lock • Tap a door with a 10-foot pole

## Movement

_"Movement Cost +1" means that the you must spend 1 extra foot of SPEED per foot of MOVEMENT._

_"Idempotent" means that applying the effect more than once has the same result as applying it just once._

If you have multiple speeds (such as walk and fly), then you can switch between them. Subtract the total distance traveled from the new speed when you switch.

DIFFICULT TERRAIN has Movement Cost +1 and is idempotent with itself. An occupied space (friend or foe) is always DIFFICULT TERRAIN.

Dropping into a PRONE position does not use up MOVEMENT.  
However, STANDING UP costs half your SPEED.  

CRAWLING (moving while PRONE) has Movement Cost +1.

You can move through spaces occupied by non-hostiles.  
You can move through spaces occupied by hostiles if they are 2 [Size Categories](/Reference/size_categories.md) different than you.  
You cannot willingly end your turn in any creature's space.  
If you leave a hostile creature's REACH, you provoke an ATTACK OF OPPORTUNITY.  

A flying creature who is unable to MOVE will fall, unless they can hover or such. This could be because they were knocked PRONE, or because their SPEED was reduced to 0, for instance.

Creatures can squeeze through a SPACE that is one SIZE smaller than itself.
- Has Movement Cost +1.
- DISADVANTAGE on ATTACK rolls.
- DISADVANTAGE on DEXTERITY SAVING THROWS.
- Attackers have ADVENTAGE on ATTACK rolls.

## Action

You may do one of the following, or take a class action, a special feature action, or an improvised action. The DM will tell you if your improvised action is possible, and if so what to ROLL to make to see if it succeeds.

| Action | Effects |
| ---    | ---     |
| Attack | Make 1 melee or ranged attack against a creature. Some features let you make multiple ATTACKS in one ACTION. |
| Cast spell | Cast a spell with a "1 ACTION" casting time. |
| Dash | Double your SPEED for this turn. |
| Disengage | Your MOVEMENT does not provoke an ATTACK OF OPPORTUNITY for this turn. |
| Dodge | Until the start of your next turn, all attacks against you from opponents you can see are at DISADVANTAGE. You make DEXTERITY SAVING THROWS with ADVANTAGE. You lose this effect if you're incapacitated or your speed is reduced to 0. |
| Help Aid | You can aid another creature in completing a task. The creature will have ADVANTAGE on its next ABILITY CHECK to complete this task (until the start of your next turn). |
| Help Distract | You help attack a creature within 5 feet of you. The next ally attacking this creature does so with ADVANTAGE (until the start of your next turn). |
| Hide | Make a DEXTERITY(STEALTH) check for hide (**see ch 7**) If you succeed **see Unseen Attackers and Targets** |
| Ready | Prepare a REACTION to be used before the start of your next turn. Specify a TRIGGER. Specify the ACTION or MOVEMENT you will take in response. If the trigger happens, you have the option to ignore it. MOVEMENT is limited by your SPEED. Spells still need a "1 Action" case time and they all require CONCENTRATION. |
| Search | Focus on finding something. The DM will specify a WISDOM(PERCEPTION) check or INTELLIGENCE(INVESTIGATION) check. |
| Use an object | For when the interaction you want to make requires a full action. |

## Attack

1) Choose a target within range  
2) Determine modifiers (such as cover, advantage, etc)  
3) Resolve the attack: make your ATTACK ROLL. On a hit, ROLL DAMAGE.

An ATTACK ROLL is 1d20 + modifiers.
- Melee attacks use STRENGTH modifier.
- Ranged attacks use DEXERITY modifier.
- Spells use the appropriate spell-casting modifier for your class.
- Add your PROFICIENCY BONUS if your are PROFICIENT with this type of [weapon](/Reference/weapons.md).
- CRITICAL HIT: A natural 20 (without modifiers) results in a successful ATTACK, regardless of everything else.
- CRITICAL MISS: A natural 1 (without modifiers) results in a failed ATTACK, regardless of everything else.

A HIT occurs when your ATTACK ROLL meets or beats the target's ARMOR CLASS.

You have DISADVANTAGE to attack a creature you cannot see. This can happen when you are guessing at their location, or you can hear but not see them.

You have ADVANTAGE to attack creatures that cannot see you. But you will give away your location whether you hit or not.

## Reaction

**Reactions** are instant responses to a trigger. They can occur on your turn or on someone else's turn.

**Opportunity Attack**
