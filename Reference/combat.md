# Combat

**Round**: Each participant in combat gets one turn per round. A round takes about `6 seconds` in-game time.

**Turn**: One participant gets one turn per round of combat. (More below)

**Turn Order**: Determined at the beginning of combat. All participants roll initiative, and those with the higher initiative go before those with lower initiative (**Initiative Order**). This order remains the same for the whole combat.
- If player characters tie, they decide amongst themselves who goes first.
- If NPCs tie, the DM decides who goes first.

**Roll Initiative**: Make a DEXTERITY check. Be default, the DUNGEON MASTER rolls once for an entire group of identical enemy NPCs.

**Surprise**: If DEXTERITY(STEALTH) exceeds the PASSIVE PERCEPTION of opposing characters, then you can make a surprise attack. Surprise is not possible without an attempt at stealth.
- If you are SURPRISED
  - No movement or action for your first turn in combat.
  - No reaction until your first turn in combat ends.
- SURPRISE is checked for each character, so some can be surprised while others are not.

**Space**: The region of map that a creature controls. See [Size Categories](/Reference/size_categories.md).

**Contest**: A contest is when attacker and defender both roll the same skill check. The attacker wins if their meet or beat the defender's roll.

**Hit Points**: A combination of physical and mental durability. All DAMAGE is subtracted from your HIT POINTS. You retain full capabilities until your HIT POINTS reaches 0.

## Step-by-Step

1) Determine surprise  
2) Establish positions  
3) Roll initiative  
4) Takes turns (repeat in initiative order until combat ends)  

## Turn

**Move**: You can move up to your SPEED. If SPEED is 35 feet, then you can move 0 to 35 feet.

**Action**: You can take one action.

**Bonus Action**: If a class feature, spell, or ability says you can take it as a bonus action, then you can take it as an additional ACTION on your turn. You are limited to 1 bonus action per turn.

You can order MOVE, ACTION, and BONUS ACTION as you like (provided no other rules disallows it).  
You can split your MOVE up to before and after your ACTION.  
You can split your MOVE up between ATTACKS, if your ACTION includes multiple ATTACKS.  
You can skip any part of your turn.  

Other things you can mix into your turn:
- Brief communication, by speech or gesture.
- Interaction with 1 object or environmental feature.
  
The DM can decide if something requires your ACTION for the turn. Here are examples of usually-allowed interactions: • Open a door during MOVE • Draw your weapon during ACTION to attack • Hand an item to another character • Getting a potion out • Pick up a dropped weapon, or a torch from a sconce • Take a bauble off the table, or a book from a shelf (within reach) • Remove a ring from your finger • Stuff some food in your mouth, or down a flagon • Plant a banner in the ground • Fish a few coins from your belt pouch • Throw a lever • Extinguish a small fire • Don a mask • Pull on or take off your hood • Put your ear to a door • Kick a small stone • Turn a key in a lock • Tap a door with a 10-foot pole

## Movement

_"Movement Cost +1" means that the you must spend 1 extra foot of SPEED per foot of MOVEMENT._

_"Idempotent" means that applying the effect more than once has the same result as applying it just once._

If you have multiple speeds (such as walk and fly), then you can switch between them. Subtract the total distance traveled from the new speed when you switch.

DIFFICULT TERRAIN has Movement Cost +1 and is idempotent with itself. An occupied space (friend or foe) is always DIFFICULT TERRAIN.

Dropping into a PRONE position does not use up MOVEMENT.  
However, STANDING UP costs half your SPEED.  

CRAWLING (moving while PRONE) has Movement Cost +1.

You can move through spaces occupied by non-hostiles.  
You can move through spaces occupied by hostiles if they are 2 [Size Categories](/Reference/size_categories.md) different than you.  
You cannot willingly end your turn in any creature's space.  
If you leave a hostile creature's REACH, you provoke an ATTACK OF OPPORTUNITY.  

A flying creature who is unable to MOVE will fall, unless they can hover or such. This could be because they were knocked PRONE, or because their SPEED was reduced to 0, for instance.

Creatures can squeeze through a SPACE that is one SIZE smaller than itself.
- Has Movement Cost +1.
- DISADVANTAGE on ATTACK rolls.
- DISADVANTAGE on DEXTERITY SAVING THROWS.
- Attackers have ADVENTAGE on ATTACK rolls.

When MOVING a GRAPPLED creature who is not 2 or more SIZES smaller than you, your SPEED is halved.

Once during MOVEMENT, you can MOUNT or DISMOUNT a creature within 5 feet of you. This costs half your SPEED.

## Action

You may do one of the following, or take a class action, a special feature action, or an improvised action. The DM will tell you if your improvised action is possible, and if so what to ROLL to make to see if it succeeds.

| Action | Effects |
| ---    | ---     |
| Attack | Make 1 melee or ranged attack against a creature. Some features let you make multiple ATTACKS in one ACTION. |
| Cast spell | Cast a spell with a "1 ACTION" casting time. |
| Dash | Double your SPEED for this turn. |
| Disengage | Your MOVEMENT does not provoke an ATTACK OF OPPORTUNITY for this turn. |
| Dodge | Until the start of your next turn, all attacks against you from opponents you can see are at DISADVANTAGE. You make DEXTERITY SAVING THROWS with ADVANTAGE. You lose this effect if you're incapacitated or your speed is reduced to 0. |
| Help Aid | You can aid another creature in completing a task. The creature will have ADVANTAGE on its next ABILITY CHECK to complete this task (until the start of your next turn). |
| Help Distract | You help attack a creature within 5 feet of you. The next ally attacking this creature does so with ADVANTAGE (until the start of your next turn). |
| Hide | If the DM allows it, make a DEXTERITY(STEALTH) roll. You are now hidden from view. Your DEX roll is the DC for all WISDOM(PERCEPTION) checks searching for you. |
| Ready | Prepare a REACTION to be used before the start of your next turn. Specify a TRIGGER. Specify the ACTION or MOVEMENT you will take in response. If the trigger happens, you have the option to ignore it. MOVEMENT is limited by your SPEED. Spells still need a "1 Action" case time and they all require CONCENTRATION. |
| Search | Focus on finding something. The DM will specify a WISDOM(PERCEPTION) check or INTELLIGENCE(INVESTIGATION) check. |
| Use an object | For when the interaction you want to make requires a full action. |
| Stabilize | Administer first aid to a creature at 0 HIT POINTS. Roll DC 10 WISDOM(MEDICINE). |

## Attack

1) Choose a target within range  
2) Determine modifiers (such as cover, advantage, etc)  
3) Resolve the attack: make your ATTACK ROLL. On a hit, ROLL DAMAGE.

An ATTACK ROLL is 1d20 + modifiers.
- Melee attacks use STRENGTH modifier.
- Ranged attacks use DEXERITY modifier.
- Spells use the appropriate spell-casting modifier for your class.
- Add your PROFICIENCY BONUS if your are PROFICIENT with this type of [weapon](/Reference/weapons.md).
- CRITICAL HIT: A natural 20 (without modifiers) results in a successful ATTACK, regardless of everything else. You also roll for DAMAGE twice (adding modifiers only once).
- CRITICAL MISS: A natural 1 (without modifiers) results in a failed ATTACK, regardless of everything else.

A HIT occurs when your ATTACK ROLL meets or beats the target's ARMOR CLASS.

The ROLL DAMAGE is based on the weapon type + ABILITY MODIFIER. If you damage multiple creatures with one attack, roll damage once and apply it to all affected creatures.

You have DISADVANTAGE to attack a creature you cannot see. This can happen when you are guessing at their location, or you can hear but not see them.

You have ADVANTAGE to attack creatures that cannot see you. But you will give away your location whether you hit or not.

If you don't have a weapon, you can use an UNARMED STRIKE (punch, kick, head but). A HIT deals BLUDGEONING damage at 1 + STRENGTH MODIFIER.

GRAPPLE is a special MELEE ATTACK in which you try to seize and wrestle with a target.
- The target can be up to 1 SIZE larger than you.
- The target must be within REACH.
- You must have at least 1 hand free.
- Grappling is a STRENGTH(ATHLETICS) CONTEST. The target may choose to use DEXTERITY(ACROBATICS) instead.
- You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated.
- If you succeed, the target is GRAPPLED.
- Releasing a GRAPPLED target does not take an ACTION.
- To escape a GRAPPLE, use your ACTION in the same CONTEST above. You are still the "target".

SHOVE is a special MELEE ATTACK in which you try to knock a target PRONE, or push them away from you.
- The target can be up to 1 SIZE larger than you.
- The target must be within REACH.
- Shoving is a STRENGTH(ATHLETICS) CONTEST. The target may choose to use DEXTERITY(ACROBATICS) instead.
- You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated.
- If you succeed, the target is knocked PRONE or is pushed 5 feet away from you.

DAMAGE TYPES: Acid • Bludgeoning • Cold • Fire • Force • Lightening • Necrotic • Piercing • Poison • Psychic • Radiant • Slashing • Thunder
- RESISTANCE to a damage type means the creature takes half damage.
- VULNERABILITY to a damage type means the creature takes double damage.
- RESISTANCE and VULNERABILITY are applied after all other modifiers to the DAMAGE.
- RESISTANCE and VULNERABILITY are idempotent.

## Reaction

Creatures are limited to 1 REACTION each ROUND.

**Reactions** are instant responses to a trigger. They can occur on your turn or on someone else's turn.

**Opportunity Attacks** are an automatic reaction to a hostile creature moving in or out of your REACH.
- A hostile creature you can see MOVES out of your REACH. You make 1 MELEE ATTACK against them just before they leave your REACH.
- You do not PROVOKE if you DISENGAGE, teleport, or are moved by an outside force.

## Cover

Cover makes a target more difficult to harm. It can be provided by walls, trees, creatures, etc between the attacker and target.

Cover is equal to the one most helpful piece of cover you have. So 1/2 cover + 3/4 cover = 3/4 cover.

| Degree of Cover | Description | Bonus |
| ---             | ---         | ---   |
| 1/2             | At least 1/2 the creature is covered. | +2 AC, +2 DEXTERITY SAVING ROLLS |
| 3/4             | At least 3/4 the creature is covered. | +5 AC, +5 DEXTERITY SAVING ROLLS |
| total           | All of the creature is covered. | Cannot be targeted directly |

## 0 Hit Points

Dropping to 0 HIT POINTS either result in instant death, or falling unconscious. If the damage is dealt by a PLAYER CHARACTER making a MELEE ATTACK, the player can decide they knocked the creature unconscious instead of killing it.

INSTANT DEATH occurs when you drop to 0 HP and the remaining DAMAGE meets or beats your MAX HP.

Otherwise, you fall unconscious. Regaining any HP will wake you up.

When you start your turn with 0 HIT POINTS, you must make DEATH SAVING THROWS.
- Roll a DC 10 1d20. A 1 counts as 2 failures. A 20 regains you 1 HP.
- 3 successes makes you STABLE
- 3 failures makes you DEAD
- Roll once per turn

Taking any damage while at 0 HP counts as a failed DEATH SAVING THROW. Damage from a CRITICAL HIT counts as 2 failures. If the damage meets or beats your MAX HP, you are dead.

Receiving TEMPORARY HIT POINTS will not STABLIZE or return to consciousness a creature at 0 HP. They can absorb DAMAGE, though.

A STABLE creature does not need to make DEATH SAVING THROWS, and their successes and failures reset to 0. They are still unconscious. They regain 1 HIT POINT after 1d4 hours.

Monsters are generally considered dead at 0 HP. It's up to the DM.

## Temporary Hit Points

Temporary hit points are a pool of HP that you use up before your normal HP. They can exceed your MAXIMUM HIT POINTS.

Healing cannot restore temporary hit points.

Temporary hit points cannot be added together. If you have some, and gain some more, you decide to keep the first amount or replace it with the new amount.

Temporary hit points are lost after a LONG REST.

## Mounted Combat

A WILLING creature at least 1 SIZE larger than you can be a mount.

If any effect moves your mount against its will while you are MOUNTED, you must make a DC 10 DEXTERITY SAVING THROW or you will fall off. You will land PRONE within 5 feet of the MOUNT. Make the same saving throw if you are knocked PROVE while MOUNTED.

If your mount is knocked PRONE, you can use your REACTION to DISMOUNT as it falls. You land on your feet. Otherwise, its like being thrown off above.

You can either control the mount, or let it act independently. INTELLIGENT creatures (like dragons) act independently. You can only control a mount if it is trained (domestic animals are assumed trained).

A CONTROLLED mount's INITIATIVE changes to match yours when you MOUNT it. It can MOVE and ACT on the same turn you MOUNT it. Its ACTION options are DASH, DISENGAGE, and DODGE.

If the mount provokes an OPPORTUNITY ATTACK, the attacker can target you or the mount.

## Underwater Combat

MELEE ATTACKS have DISADVANTAGE if the attacker has no SWIMMING SPEED. Exceptions are daggers, javelins, shortswords, spears, tridents.

RAGNED ATTACKS automatically miss beyond the NORMAL RANGE. In NORMAL RANGE, they have DISADVANTAGE except for crossbows, nets, or anything thrown like a javelin.

FULLY IMMERSED creatures have RESISTANCE to FIRE DAMAGE.
