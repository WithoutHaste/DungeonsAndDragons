# Skills

(PHB 174-179)

A skill represents a particular aspect of an ability score.

If you are proficient in a skill, you can add your proficiency bonus to rolls for that skill.

A passive check is done without a die roll. You take the passive roll plus modifiers: 10 (passive) + 2 (ability). Add 5 more if they have advantage.

If multiple players work together on something, let the most capable roll with advantage to represent the group.  You can only help if you had some chance of succeeding alone. Example: unblocking a cave-in.

Alternately, everyone in the group rolls. Half of them need to succeed for the whole group to succeed. Example: avoiding dangers in a swamp.

You succeed at a Saving Throw is you meet or beat the DC (difficulty class).
