# Town of Tunly

A mainly human town, but they see other races passing through enough that they aren't startled at any race. The town is used to trading with adventures, but is not dependent on them - the town also farms and does other normal town things.

They see a lot of adventurers come through, heading into the Standing Forest. Some of them never return.s

The town contains a few hundred people, with more living in the surrounding countryside. They have a Mayor.

## History

Tunly was an adventurer (ranger) who, having returned from the forest, decided to settle down and trade with adventurers rather than continue to be one himself.

Tunly is just west of the Mallow River. [The Standing Forest](/Locations/Standing_Forest.md) begins on the far shore of the river.

The road outside town leads east to the Mallow River ford, which is easily crossed (2 feet deep, 150 feet across) in the summer and fall. It ices over in winter.  In spring it is 15 feet deep and 200 feet across, very fast, and dangerously full of tree limbs.
