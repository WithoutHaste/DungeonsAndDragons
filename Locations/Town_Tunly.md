# Town of Tunly

A mainly human town, but they see other races passing through enough that they aren't startled at any race.

They see a lot of adventurers come through, heading into the Standing Forest. Some of them never return.

## History

Tunly was an adventurer (ranger) who, having returned from the forest, decided to settle down and trade with adventurers rather than continue to be one himself. The town still caters to adventurers, but is not dependent on them - the town also farms and does other normal town things.
