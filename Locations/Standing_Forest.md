# The Standing Forest

## History

The Standing Forest used to be known as the Walking Forest. The forest advanced over the mountains and across several cities. Their ruins are now deep in the forest.

About 500 years ago, {TBD} happened and the trees set down their roots and stopped walking. It appears to be a normal forest now, but remains difficult to penetrate or to build roads or towns/cities within. It's edges haven't changed noticeably in all this time.

## Contents

The forest contains entire ruined cities, bandits, monsters, mystics and hermits, and anything else you'd like to add.

It is hundreds of miles deep. It stretches beyond the mountains.

## Hemlock Lake

A quiet lake about an hours hike east from the Mallow River ford. No birds rest here, and no fish live in the lake. Animals avoid this place. The only creatures commonly around the lake are flies and Hemlock Frogs.

Hemlock Lake gets it name from its poisoned waters. However, the small streams that feed the lake are safe to drink from.

People get a creeping feeling of wrongness when near the lake. The feeling gets very strong if they enter the lake.

There is a demon bound at the bottom of Hemlock lake. _Details to be revealed when we reach that scenario_

Intelligence(History) check DC 12 to know about a demon being sealed at the bottom of a lake in this area.

### Hemlock Frogs

Hemlock Frogs have absorbed the poison of the lake.

The croaking of these frogs puts people to sleep. If you rest within earshot of the frogs, make a DC 17 Constitution save every 30 minutes to avoid falling into a drugged sleep.

If you sleep near Hemlock Frogs, they'll hop over and sit on you. When they sit on exposed flesh, the poison on their skin soaks into you. Take 1d4 poison damage every 30 minutes until you wash off.
