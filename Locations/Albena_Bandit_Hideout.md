# Albena's Bandit Hideout

Located in the [Standing Forest](/Locations/Standing_Forest.md) a bit south-west of the [Arch Tree](/Scenarios/005_The_Arch_Tree.md).

There is a small group of derelict buildings, mostly so old and collapsed as to be useless. The bandits have made the building in best condition into their hideout.

## The Bandits

A group of bandits led by [Albena](/Characters/Albena_Bandit_Chief.md). They are from near the city Mirn Thurum (first mentioned by character Norric).

Albena brought her band out here when word got around of an amazing gem stone under a tree (the Arch Tree). She knows that this tree belongs to the vengeful Fae, so she will not steal the gem directly. The plan is to wait nearby until someone else steals it, then steal it from them.

They've been out here four months, waiting patiently. During that time, the [Autumnal Druid](/Characters/Druid_Meinrad_Ozga.md) came across them and hired them to capture live, evil-aligned creatures for his work.
