Human > Man > 54 years old.

He's currently trying to returning [The Standing Forest](/Locations/Standing_Forest.md) to being the Walking Forest, as it was in days of old - it marched across the countryside, overrunning farm and town.

Certainly above level 2, maybe around 6?

Will employ evil creatures, alignment {tbd}
