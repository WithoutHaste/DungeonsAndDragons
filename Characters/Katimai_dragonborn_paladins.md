Roughly using the translator here: https://draconic.twilightrealm.com/

Do not introduce themselves when in a hurry to catch Autumnal Druid. If pressed for names:
- "I am Muumtindrish; these are by brothers Drildanthojac, Shirjecnijik, Omtecan, and Listijuul."
- If the players comment on the difficulty of the names, he gives a hearty laugh and says,
"Draconic is a difficult language for mammals. Please, call me Tindrish."     

Refer to tieflings as "sons/daughters of [bloodline]"
- e.g. for Barnabus: "son of Zariel"
- "I mean no offense. I refer only to your ancestry. We are descendants of Tiamat, but it is Bahamut whom we serve. Ancestry is in the past; it is our actions that define the future."

Refer to their enemies / evil creatures as "sons"
